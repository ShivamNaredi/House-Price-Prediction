Home Price Prediction Web Application
Developed a web application for home price prediction utilizing a machine learning model to provide accurate price estimates based on various property features. The project involved:
Backend Development: Leveraged Flask to create a RESTful API that serves as the backbone of the application. Implemented endpoints to retrieve location names and predict home prices based on user inputs, ensuring a seamless interaction between the frontend and backend.
Machine Learning Model: Built and trained a predictive model using historical housing data to estimate property prices. The model takes inputs such as total area, number of bedrooms (BHK), number of bathrooms, and location to deliver a reliable price estimate.
Frontend Development: Designed an attractive user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on user experience. The UI includes input validation, dynamic dropdowns for location selection, and a responsive layout. Implemented user-friendly features to restrict inputs for BHK and bathrooms to values between 1 and 5.
Deployment: Deployed the application locally, with future plans for cloud deployment to make it accessible to users globally.
This project showcases my skills in web development, machine learning, and user interface design, reflecting my commitment to creating data-driven solutions.
